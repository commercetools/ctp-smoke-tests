# Contributing

## Review process

### 1. Open a PR

Once you're satisfied with the branch you're working one, you can open a PR.

It is important to provide enough contextual information in the PR description, to make it easier for reviewers. 

### 2. Check that all tests are passing

All PRs are automatically checked on [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/commercetools/ctp-smoke-tests).

The github checks make sure that the tests are successful before merging a PR.

### 3. Wait for approval

Ask & wait for 1 approval.

A guide for reviewing code and having your code reviewed: [thoughtbot/guides/code-review](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review).

### 4. Mark you PR as ready to be merged

Tag your PR with `ship it` when it's ready to be merged.

The [kodiak](https://github.com/chdsbd/kodiak) bot will merge your PR.
